## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I joined Frontend Mentor to practice and learn Tailwind CSS, with the goal of eventually diving into the Next.js ecosystem, where Tailwind is commonly used. This was my first time using Tailwind, and I really enjoyed getting to know how it works.

At first, the utility-first approach felt unfamiliar, but as I spent more time with it, I started to appreciate how quick, flexible, and intuitive it is. Instead of spending time coming up with custom class names or jumping between CSS and HTML files, I could style elements directly within the markup using Tailwind's predefined utility classes. This made the workflow feel much faster and more efficient.

For example, I used the max-w-xs class to set the maximum width of the card to 320px — without needing to write any custom CSS. Tailwind already had it predefined, which saved time and made the code more consistent.

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing and building projects to strengthen my understanding of Tailwind CSS. My goal is to become more comfortable using utility classes effectively and to deepen my knowledge of responsive design, component structure, and customization within the Tailwind framework. This will also help prepare me for working with frameworks like Next.js, where Tailwind is often used in production environments.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Play CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn) – This was my starting point for using Tailwind without setting up a full build process. It made it really easy to experiment and see results instantly, which was super helpful.

- [Tailwind Cheat Sheet – Nerdcave](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) - This cheat sheet was incredibly useful for quickly looking up class names and syntax while working on the project. It's a great reference to have open alongside your code.

- [Tailwind Color Reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) – This helped me understand and apply Tailwind’s color system correctly. I referred to it often while matching the design specs and choosing semantic, accessible colors.
